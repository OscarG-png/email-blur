## Project

A simple chrome extension for hiding a users email in the browser.
Useful for when you're broadcasting and don't want your personal email leaked.

# Notes

Mostly works so far, currently hides ALL email addresses in the DOM.
Currently doesn't work in some parts of gmail. Doesn't work If you click on your user icon to change emails.
